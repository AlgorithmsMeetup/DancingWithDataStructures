# DancingWithDataStructures: Stacks and Queues

## Introduction to Data Structures

Welcome to the wonderful world of data structures! If this is your first exposure to the subject, check out this [gentle introduction](http://blog.benoitvallon.com/data-structures-in-javascript/data-structures-in-javascript/).

## Implementation

The first step to understanding data structures is learning how to build them, and what the advantages of each type are. For more on this topic, check out an explanantion of [stack](http://blog.benoitvallon.com/data-structures-in-javascript/the-stack-data-structure/) and [queue](http://blog.benoitvallon.com/data-structures-in-javascript/the-queue-data-structure/).

### Classic Questions

Once you feel like you've got a solid grasp of how these data structures work, go ahead and clone and take the repo for a whirl and take a stab at two classic interview questions making use of the stack and queue data structures, respectively.

##  Reimplementation (Using Other Data Structures)

Once you've done that level up by reimplementing these data structures using the other data structure!
